At this time tripeptide-32, like most other peptides, has theoretical skin-restoring ability and likely serves to bind moisture to skin, but all other fantastic-sounding claims remain in the realm of a petri dish or are simply unproven or unknown.","1736":"Also known as false mayweed or sea mayweed, this plant extract encompasses the entire plant. Raw material research from the supplier has conclusively shown that when this plant extract is applied to skin, it hydrates, calms, and softens. Tripleurospermum maritimum extract is a rich source of amino acids and fructose.","1737":"Similar to tetrasodium EDTA. Used as a water-softening and chelating agent (a compound that binds and separates metals, keeping them from bonding to other ingredients).","1738":"Extract from the germ portion of the wheat plant. In cosmetics, this ingredient functions\u00a0 as a skin-softening and hair-conditioning agent. As its derived from wheat, it's a source of the protein gluten.","1739":"","1740":"A flavonoid ingredient that's extracted from the Japanese plant Sophora japonica. It functions as an antioxidant.","1741":"","1742":"Turmeric is a spice made from the dried, ground root of the Curcuma longa plant. It contains curcumin, a lipophilic, polyphenolic antioxidant pigment that gives turmeric its golden-yellow color.","1743":"Also known as coenzyme Q10, it is a vitamin-like, fat-soluble substance naturally present in the body. Applied to skin, it can have antioxidant benefits due to its energizing effect on factors in skin that tend to slow down with age and cumulative sun exposure.","1744":"","1745":"Inorganic, synthetic pigments (of various colors) permanently listed by the FDA for external use only, including deemed safe for use around the eye area. Some sources of ultramarines are mineral, but the process of turning the raw mineral into various ultramarine pigments means it's no longer a natural ingredient. That's actually a good thing, because raw minerals extracted from the earth can contain heavy metals that pose a health risk.","1746":"Extract from the plant known as sea lettuce, it has some skin-soothing and antioxidant properties for skin.","1747":"Also known as cat\u2019s claw, there is some research showing it to be an effective skin-soothing and antioxidant.","1748":"Undaria pinnatifida, also known as brown algae, is a type of seaweed that\u2019s also edible. As with most seaweeds, it\u2019s a rich source of nutrients, and those benefit skin when applied topically. Among the benefits from applying brown algae to skin are antioxidant from its polyphenols, hydration from its polysaccharides, and soothing, thanks to a compound known as fucoidan.","1749":"Component of urine, although synthetic versions are used in cosmetics. In small amounts, urea has beneficial water-binding and mild exfoliating properties for skin. In larger concentrations it can cause sensitivity, though large amounts can also exfoliate skin.","1750":"","1751":"Ultraviolet A radiation. The sun produces a range of ultraviolet (UV) radiation, of which UVA and UVB affect our skin. UVA rays have wavelengths of 320 to 400 nanometers; UVB rays have wavelengths of 290 to 320 nanometers. UVB radiation causes sunburn, while UVA radiation does not produce any visible short-term evidence of skin damage. Nonetheless, UVA radiation creates serious cumulative changes in skin that may be far greater than the sunburn caused by UVB radiation. Research has shown that unprotected exposure to UVA rays can, within one week, create distinct injury.","1752":"","1753":"Ultraviolet B\u00a0radiation, which reaches skin and causes sunburn and other damage to skin.","1754":"","1755":"Latin term for cranberry.","1756":"Bilberry is one of the best sources of antioxidant compounds known as anthocyanins, polyphenolic chemicals that give bilberries their dark color. Not surprisingly, bilberries are similar to blueberries.","1757":"Vaccinium vitis-idaea (also known as lingonberry) is a wild-growing Scandinavian-native berry that\u2019s similar in nutrient profile and size with its plant \u201ccousin\u201d, blueberry. The bright red color of lingonberries is evidence of its different antioxidant compounds compared to blueberries, but both are great sources of polyphenols that defend skin against environmental damage.","1758":"Blueberry fruit extract is a natural ingredient that is used for its potent antioxidant and skin-conditioning benefits. Blueberry contains several types of antioxidants (known as polyphenolics) that are not only healthy for your body when eaten but also for your skin when applied via skincare products.","1759":"","1760":"Vanilla planifolia fruit extract is a natural ingredient used in skin care primarily for its antioxidant benefits. The vanilla plant\u2019s seed, commonly referred to as vanilla bean, is a source of catechins (also known as polyphenols), which have antioxidant activity and serve as skin-soothing agents.","1761":"According to the Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database online, verbena is a fragrant plant extract that can be a skin sensitizer when applied topically or consumed orally; however, like most plants, it's also a rich source of antioxidants and contains compounds that also provide various health benefits.","1762":"Fragrant component in skincare products that can also be a skin sensitizer.","1763":"Blend of silicone polymers that functions as a thickening agent and texture enhancer.","1764":"","1765":"","1766":"","1767":"Overall there is limited research showing vitamin B12 has any benefit when applied topically on skin; however, it may exert some benefits in concern with other vitamins and antioxidants.","1768":"There is no research showing this has any benefit when applied topically to skin.","1769":"","1770":"","1771":"Also known as pyridoxine, there is no research showing this B vitamin has any benefit when applied to skin.","1772":"Vitamin C is one of the most well-researched and beneficial vitamins you can apply topically. Ongoing use has been shown to improve the look of multiple signs of aging, brighten an uneven skin tone, as well as provide skin-restoring and soothing benefits.","1773":"A fat-soluble vitamin that may have antioxidant and skin-soothing benefits for skin, among other beneficial traits. Vitamin D is formed in the skin by sunlight (primarily unprotected exposure to UVB radiation), or may be obtained from fortified foods and oral supplements, which are the preferred methods compared to exposing your skin to sunlight.","1774":"One of the most well-known and researched antioxidants for the body and for skin. Vitamin E occurs naturally in human skin, but can become depleted due to constant environmental exposure in the absence of sun protection.","1775":"Name sometimes used to represent essential fatty acids of linoleic acid and linolenic acid. There are many fatty acids that have benefit for skin, including arachidonic, eicosapentaenoic, docosahexaenoic, and oleic acids to name a few. These all have emollient, hydrating, replenishing, and often antioxidant properties for skin.","1776":"","1777":"Technically known as phytonadione, vitamin K is a fat-soluble vitamin. Applying vitamin K to the surface of the skin won't improve the look of unevenness or dark circles. This type of vitamin K is also referred to as vitamin K1.\nA study published in the Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology (April 2004, page 73) examined the effect of applying a gel containing 2% vitamin K plus 0.1% retinol, vitamin E, and vitamin C. Fifty-seven adults with dark circles participated in this 8-week study and the results, while not a slam-dunk, weren't exactly discouraging either: 47% of the testers noted \"fair to moderate\" improvement in their dark circles.","1778":"Latin name for the vines that produce wine grapes. More commonly known as grape seed oil or grape seed extract.","1779":"Group of volatile fluids derived primarily from plants and used in cosmetics primarily as fragrant additives. These components most often include a mix of alcohols, ketones, phenols, linalool, borneol, terpenes, camphor, pinene, acids, ethers, aldehydes, citral, and sulfur, all of which have extremely sensitizing effects on skin. Volatile oils also bring benefits to skin, most notably from their antioxidants, but there are other ingredients, including many natural ingredients, that provide these same benefits without the risk of aggravating skin.","1780":"Film-forming agent often used in water-resistant sunscreen products. It helps the sunscreen adhere better to skin and resist breaking down in water. It does not, however, last for hours, which is why you must reapply even water-resistant sunscreens at regular intervals.","1781":"Synthetic polymer that functions as a binding agent, texture enhancer, and dispersing agent in cosmetics","1782":"Extract that can have antioxidant properties for skin.","1783":"Emollient, non-fragrant plant oil that is agood source of omega fatty acids for skin, namely linoleic acid; however, walnut oil is highly prone to oxidation, which makes the right packaging critical. Airless of air-restrictive and opaque packaging is a must.","1784":"Abrasive used in scrub products. Walnut shell powder is not preferred to polyethylene beads in a scrub because it\u2019s impossible to make walnut shell particles smooth, which means the sharp edges can cause microscopic scrapes in skin every time you use it.","1785":"Most widely used cosmetic ingredient; water is almost always listed first on an ingredient label because it is usually the ingredient with the highest concentration in the formula. Despite claims of skin\u2019s need for hydration and claims regarding special types of water, it turns out that water may not be an important ingredient for skin. Only a 10% concentration of water in the outer layer of skin is necessary for softness and pliability in this part of the epidermis. Studies that have compared the water content of dry skin with that of normal or oily skin do not find a statistically significant difference in moisture levels between them.","1786":"Research indicates that watercress extracts can have antioxidant activity, but that information is limited and was carried out either in vitro or as animal experiments, not in skincare products.","1787":"Extract from the fruit Citrullus lantus, commonly known as watermelon. This plant extract, like most types of melon, is a rich source of antioxidants, including lycopene.","1788":"A blend of amino acids from wheat protein after it has been broken down via hydrolysis. Most often used in hair-care products as a conditioning agent, but also found in skincare products where it likely has hydrating ability. There is limited research showing that wheat amino acids can penetrate the hair shaft; however, most likely the smaller molecular size of the amino acids can penetrate hair better than whole protein sources.","1789":"Natural ingredient used as emollient and texture enhancer in cosmetics.","1790":"Emollient plant oil similar to all non-fragrant plant oils.","1791":"","1792":"A form of protein derived from milk. An animal-derived ingredient, whey protein functions as a hair-conditioning and skin-softening agent.","1793":"Plant ingredient that contains components that can have both soothing and sensitizing properties.","1794":"","1795":"Extract from the minimally processed buds and leaves of green tea. There is research showing that white and green teas have the highest concentration of antioxidant properties (via their polyphenol and flavonoid content) of all teas. However, even though tea flavonoids are effective antioxidants, it is unclear to what extent they increase the antioxidant capacity of humans.","1796":"","1797":"","1798":"Plant extract that contains salicin, a substance that when taken orally is converted by the digestive process to salicylic acid (beta hydroxy acid).","1799":"","1800":"A type of mint that is often used for addressing the discomfort of sore muscles, but spearmint oil can be very sensitizing due to its high volume of an ingredient known as methyl salicylate.","1801":"Commonly used plant extract that can have potent antioxidant properties and some soothing properties. However, witch hazel\u2019s high tannin content (tannin is a potent antioxidant) can also make it sensitizing if used repeatedly on skin. The bark of the witch hazel plant has a higher tannin content than the leaves. Producing witch hazel water by steam distillation removes the tannins, but the plant\u2019s astringent qualities are what most believe give it benefit.","1802":"Natural ingredient used as a thickening agent, texture enhancer, and to stabilize emulsions, which is a general term for mixtures of unlike substances such as oil and water.","1803":"Also known as lutein, this is a cartenoid pigment from plants that functions as an antioxidant.","1804":"Latin name for plum oil; it can have emollient properties.","1805":"","1806":"Xylitol is a sugar alcohol that may be plant-derived or synthetic (Paula\u2019s Choice uses the former). In the plant world, xylitol naturally occurs in many fruits and vegetables, including mushrooms, lettuce, strawberries, bananas, and yellow plums.","1807":"An ingredient derived from two water-binding plant sugars, xylitol and glucose. Its trade name is Aquaxyl. It works to improve skin moisturization by preventing water loss.","1808":"Form of sugar. Similar to other sugars, xylose has hydrating properties for skin.","1809":"Synthetic fatty acid that functions as a skin-softening agent.","1810":"Extract for which there is little research showing it to have any benefit for skin. What studies do exist were performed in vitro, and indicate that it may have skin-soothing properties. However, yarrow also has properties that may cause skin sensitivity and photosensitivity.","1811":"Large group of fungi that ferment sugars; yeast is a source of beta-glucan, which is a good antioxidant. The types of yeast used in cosmetic products are not harmful and in fact likely contribute to creating a healthier-looking skin surface due to their softening and conditioning action.","1812":"","1813":"","1814":"A synthetic coloring agent approved for use in foods, drugs and cosmetics. The lake colors are insoluble in water, so are often used in non-aqueous cosmetics such as lipsticks and powder blush. As with all lake colors used in cosmetics, yellow 5 lake is subject to batch certification before each use in cosmetic products. This certifies purity and safety before the coloring agent is added to the product.","1815":"","1816":"Plant ingredient used in the preparation of the most popular tea-like beverage in South America. It has skin-soothing and antioxidant properties.","1817":"Fragrant, volatile oil that can also be a skin sensitizer, though it's also a potent antioxidant and may help improve uneven skin tone. It presents a bigger risk when used daily rather than intermittently.","1818":"There\u2019s limited research showing that yogurt is effective when applied topically; however, eating yogurt and other fermented dairy foods can help improve several aspects of skin.","1819":"Plant extract native to Mexico that can have skin-soothing benefits; however, its saponin content (believed to be the active part of the plant) can be sensitizing. Like most plant extracts, yucca also functions as an antioxidant.","1820":"","1821":"","1822":"Element that has growing evidence that it can be a significant soothing agent and antioxidant.","1823":"","1824":"The zinc salt of gluconic acid, a mild acid produced from the sugar glucose. Despite the in-part sugar origins, this is a synthetic ingredient that functions as a preservative. Interestingly, the human body produces gluconates on its own to assist in obtaining nutrients from minerals.","1825":"Inert earth mineral used as a thickening, lubricating, and sunscreen active ingredient in cosmetics. Along with titanium dioxide, zinc oxide is considered to have no risk of skin sensitization. As a sunscreen, it is effective in providing protection against sun\u2019s UVA rays in addition to UVB rays. Zinc oxide is also sometimes used in makeup to impart opacity to products like foundations, particularly powder-based makeup.","1826":"A synthetic skin-conditioning ingredient derived from zinc. Research has shown it has anti-aging benefits due to its ability to thwart destructive enzymes in skin that can damage its surface and lead to an aged, wrinkled appearance.","1827":"The zinc salt of stearic acid. It has multiple functions in cosmetics, including serving as the basis for soap. Also functions as a coloring agent, slip agent, and texture enhancer.","1828":"Chemical compound resulting from the interaction of zinc with sulfuric acid. There is little research showing this to be beneficial for skin. The information that is available shows that it can be a skin sensitizer when used in large amounts. A small amount of zinc sulfate is sometimes used in high-strength vitamin C treatments to stabilize the vitamin C (typically seen on the ingredient list as ascorbic acid). In these instances, the zinc sulfate is unlikely to be a source of skin sensitivity.","1829":"","1830":"The extract form is generally considered non-volatile (non-irritating) while the oil form contains over 50 such components with potential to aggravate skin.","1831":"","1832":""},"name":{"0":"1, 2-Hexanediol","1":"10-Hydroxydecanoic Acid","2":"4-T-butylcyclohexanol","3":"Acacia farnesiana
